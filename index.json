Thirty-six uncastrated male lambs (90 days old) were fed experimental diets which treatments consisted of 0%, 1%, 2%, and 4% inclusion of YME. Animals were fed for 50 days before slaughter. Muscle and meat samples were collected for metabolomics and meat quality analysis, respectively. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design and analyzed using orthogonal contrasts. There was a quadratic effect of YME inclusion in tenderness (P 0.05) on individual metabolites were observed; however, changes in the quantitative metabolic profile were observed, showing that animals fed 1 and 2% of YME have a greater concentration of desirable endogenous muscle antioxidants, with direct impact on metabolic pathways related to beta-alanine metabolism and glutathione metabolism. Therefore, YME dietary supplementation up to 2% of the diet to lambs had little to no effects on the majority of meat quality traits evaluated; moreover, 4% YME inclusion negatively affected feed intake and meat quality traits.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of dietary inclusion of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) extract on lamb muscle metabolomics and physicochemical properties in meat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica Moraes Malheiros","Banny Silva Barbosa Correia","Caroline Ceribeli","Daniel Rodrigues Cardoso","Luiz Alberto Colnago","Stanislau Bogusz Junior","James Mark Reecy","Gerson Barreto Mourão","Luiz Lehmann Coutinho","Julio Cesar Pascale Palhares","Alexandre Berndt","Luciana Correia de Almeida Regitano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623888000,"objectID":"3ea74264eb8eda079d95dd694fbc52e1","permalink":"/publication/ruminal/","publishdate":"2021-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ruminal/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted a study to identify the fecal metabolite profile and its proximity to the ruminal metabolism of Nelore steers based on an untargeted metabolomic approach.

In this paper, we report an analysis of the organization and the interconnection between unbalanced areas of study. More specifically, we considered two important subareas in analytical chemistry, namely capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass spectrometry (MS). These areas are particularly interesting because MS is employed in a bigger range of applications than CE. Consequently, these different portions of papers can interfere in the quality of the searches for papers devoted to CE–MS. Here, we considered a citation network in which the nodes and connections represent papers and citations, respectively. The network clusters were detected by employing the Infomap algorithm. By considering the clusters and the respective abstracts, the subjects were identified. Interesting results were found, including a marked separation between some clusters of articles devoted to instrumentation techniques and applications, which was quantified from the abstract contents. For instance, the most well-defined community was assigned as CE (Instru.), with 73.8% of the papers having abstracts that include the word “electrophoresis” and not the word “mass”. However, the papers that describe CE–MS did not lead to a well-defined cluster. In order to better understand the organization of the citation network, we considered a multi-scale analysis, in which we used the information regarding sub-clusters. Firstly, we analyzed the sub-cluster that contains the first article devoted to the coupling between CE and MS, whose subject was found to be a good representation of its sub-cluster. The second analysis was about the sub-cluster of a seminal paper known to be the first that dealt with protein analysis by using CE–MS and a similar result was obtained. By considering the proposed methodologies, our paper can contribute to researchers working with similar scenarios, since it shows that a given subject can be spread on many clusters of the network, therefore, lead to better literature reviews.","tags":null,"title":"How coupled are capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caroline Ceribeli","Andressa de Zawadzki","Aline MC Racanicci","Luiz A Colnago","Leif H Skibstedb","Daniel R Cardoso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527552000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527552000,"objectID":"bade0eb131f7bb32344fe773ada2a567","permalink":"/publication/mate/","publishdate":"2018-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mate/","section":"publication","summary":"Moderate supplementation with extract of mate to a standard broiler diet in feeding experiment with 5 treatment groups was found to increase production of endogenous antioxidants in muscles, improving meat quality and storage stability. For addition of 250 or 500 mg extract per kg feed, pre-cooked meatballs made from the breast muscles had a significant lower level of secondary lipid oxidation products during one week of chill storage. Addition of 750 or 1000 mg extract per kg feed had an increasing prooxidative effect during storage of the meatballs. For the moderate levels of plant phenols in feed, a metabolic study based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of meat extracts showed that mate extract added to the feed increased the muscle level of antioxidative peptides like anserine, while indication of toxic effects was noted for the higher levels of feed additives. Rate of formation of radicals as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was found to correlate with the oxidative damage and a kinetic analysis demonstrated that the antioxidative effect of mate supplemented to the feed could be assigned to radical scavengers present in the meat. These findings for the monogastric animals are different from results previously obtained for ruminants, where plant phenols rather seem to affect the microflora of the digestive tract.","tags":null,"title":"Mate as Dietary Supplement for Broiler Chickens: Effect on the Metabolic Profile and Redox Chemistry of Meat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caroline Ceribeli","Marcia Nitschke","André Luiz Meleiro Porto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497916800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497916800,"objectID":"61ecadfcfd6c303ced71a77372102633","permalink":"/publication/divulgando/","publishdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/divulgando/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of the presentation of a University Extension Project to elementary school students with information about the importance of microorganisms in daily life, using a simple and didactic approach.

Meat is a perfect protein source and supplies iron and zinc and many micronutrients like vitamins. The consumption of meat would increase in the next years because the global production in 2012 was 302 millions of tons, and actually is 319 millions of tons, approximately. Concomitantly with the increasing of global consumption of meat, two problems arise. Meat and meat products also hold the risk of inducing oxidative stress through iron catalyzed formation of reactive species or by ingestion of organic hydro peroxides during digestion. These species can cause the deterioration of the product, affecting its shelf-life, compromising its quality and influencing economic aspects. In the context of the public health, these species can generate cellular imbalance, genetic mutations, and chromosome damages, resulting in degenerative diseases of the human organism. A balanced diet should be inspired by Nature. Through evolution, oxidative stress made plants to produce bioactive compounds like xanthines and phenolic compounds to protect against oxidative stress. Yerba-mate, Ilex paraguariensis, contains relative high amounts of these compounds that act as antioxidants, which may be use as a feeding additive in order to modify the redox status of the animal organism. This may induce change in the animal metabolism, affecting the muscle tissue composition and thus the meat quality. The present investigation aims to screen changes in the polar metabolites composition and its impact on the redox stability of meat from broilers fed with different levels of yerba-mate extract as feed additive. The addition of mate extract to broilers feed clearly provided a quantitative change in the polar metabolites of meat as shown by 1H NMR analysis and impacted positively in the redox stability of meat as probed by spin-trapping EPR analysis. In conclusion, addition of 0.075 % w/w of yerba-mate extract to the broilers feed shown up like the best treatment because it produced biochemical changes in the animal metabolism improving the oxidative stability meat which may positively increase the product shelf-life and a safer and higher quality product to the consumer.","tags":null,"title":"Polar metabolites and REDOX stability in meat of broilers supplemented with Yerba-mate (Ilex paraguariensis) - Master's Dissertation - in Portuguese","type":"publication"}]
